Review 
===================================================

Review is a web application intended to aid in code reviews.
It is intended to be used within a local intranet and a trusted community
(code reviews are inherently based on trust anyway) as there is not much in
terms of security.

I hacked it together because I wanted to learn Ruby on Rails, and I needed
a project to work on (also with the goal of fulfilling a need at my current 
company).
